# Singly Linked List
**Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.**

## Challenge

**Creating a Linked List class contain the following methods:**
1. insert method:
- Arguments: value
- Returns: nothing
- Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

2. Includes method
- Arguments: value
- Returns: Boolean
- Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

3. To string method
- Arguments: none
- Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:

## Approach & Efficiency
**1. Big O for the Insert**
- Time: O(1)
- Space: O(1)

**2. Big O for the Includes**
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

**3. Big O for the To string method**
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)


## API
1. First method to add a new nodes to the first of my chain.

2. second one: Insure if my linked list have the entered value or not

3. Third one: Read what I have in my linked list.
